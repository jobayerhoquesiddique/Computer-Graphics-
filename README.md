This project implements Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm using both Pygame and Matplotlib. The Pygame version enables real-time rendering, while Matplotlib provides a static visualization. The algorithm ensures efficient and precise pixel-based line drawing without floating-point arithmetic.
# Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm - Pygame & Matplotlib

## Description
This project demonstrates Bresenham’s Line Algorithm using **Pygame** for real-time rendering and **Matplotlib** for static visualization. It includes a kite shape drawn using the algorithm, making it an excellent reference for understanding pixel-based graphics and mathematical plotting.

## Features
- **Pygame Version:** Real-time drawing of a kite using pixel-based rendering.
- **Matplotlib Version:** Static graph plotting with smooth visualization.
- **Bresenham’s Line Algorithm:** Used for precise pixel plotting without floating-point operations.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Requires only `pygame`, `matplotlib`, and `python3`.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jobayerhoquesiddique
